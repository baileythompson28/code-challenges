"""You are given an integer array height of length n. 
There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
· eg. in the example below, the coordinates of the two red lines are (1,0) to (1, 8) and (8,0) and (8,7)
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container."""
